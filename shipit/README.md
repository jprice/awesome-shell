    $ shipit exec uptime

## Configuration

You need to create `.shipit` file in your project’s directory.

Here is a typical config:

    host='myhost'
    path='sites/example.com'

    [deploy]
    git checkout master
    git pull
    npm install
    node -e "require('grunt').cli()" _ deploy

    [status]
    uptime

The only required things is `host` and `path` parameters and `[deploy]` target.

### Parameters

### host

It’s the same host you use in `ssh` command. It could be string of format `<username>@<ip>:<port>` or just a name of `~/.ssh/config` record.

### path

Project path on remote host. shipit will `cd` to this directory before executing any command.

### Targets

Target is just a bunch of shell command that will be executed on remote host via SSH. You can define as many targets as you want.

Note that you can’t use blank lines inside targets but you can use comments (#) and other things—it’s just a shell script.
